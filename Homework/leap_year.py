# The month of February normally has 28 days. But if it is a leap year, February has 29 days.
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a year. The program should then display the
# number of days in February that year. Use the following criteria to identify leap years:
# a Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and only
# if it is also divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year, but 2100 is not.
# b. If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 4.
# For example, 2008 is a leap year, but 2009 is not.

# Ask user to enter a year to determine if it's a leap year
year_entered = int(input('Enter a year to find out if it\'s a leap year: '))
